# Git Tutorial

The goal of this tutorial is to introduce you to git with practical applications
so that it becomes an integral part of your workflow.

Git is a distributed version-control system. You should typically use such
system to manage any data for which:

* You want to track (and potentially revert) changes.

* You want to maintain multiple versions of.

* You want to distribute with the possibility of merging back the distributed
  changes at a later time.

While this introduction may feel abstract, it will get more concrete as we go
through the basics and concrete applications I decided to include in this
tutorial.

It should be noted that I tried, as much as possible, to hide the graph theory
behind git. After going through the tutorial, you might feel git commits graph
is more of a tree: this is because I've chosen the material to optimize the
ratio of usefulness with respect to the difficulty of learning it.
